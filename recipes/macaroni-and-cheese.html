    <h1>Baked Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
    <img src="./images/macncheese.jpg" alt="Prepared Mac and Cheese Meal" height="500" width="500">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for four kinds of cheese, and while it may seem excessive, each serves a different purpose. In this recipe, the mornay sauce includes Cheddar, smoked Cheddar, and Colby Jack cheese to provide the optimal flavor and texture.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The smoked Cheddar is the MVP here, bringing a “subtle smokiness that’s somewhat reminiscent of bacon without having any meat added,” according to our recipe developer. A mix of shredded mozzarella and more Colby Jack cheese in the middle of the casserole and on top ensure the perfect cheese pull when you dig into this casserole.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise</li>

            <li>8 tablespoons (4 ounces) unsalted butter, melted and divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups roughly crushed buttery round crackers (such as Ritz)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (about 1 1/8 ounces) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups warm whole milk (about 105°F)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm half and half (about 105°F)</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 (0.4-ounce) cube vegetable bouillon, very finely crushed (from 1 [2.1-ounce] pkg.) (such as Knorr)</li>
            <li>8 ounces sharp yellow Cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups)</li>
            <li>4 ounces smoked yellow Cheddar cheese, shredded (1 cup)</li>
            <li>8 ounces Colby-Jack cheese, shredded and divided (2 cups)</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) dried cavatappi pasta, cooked to al dente according to package directions</li>
            <li>8 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese, shredded (2 cups), divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 13- x 9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir together crackers and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter in a medium skillet; cook, stirring often, over medium until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together flour and remaining 4 tablespoons melted butter in a large Dutch oven over medium; cook, whisking constantly, until still blond in color but bubbly and somewhat toasty in aroma, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gradually add milk and half-and-half, whisking constantly, until combined. Cook over medium, whisking often, until milk mixture can very lightly coat the back of a spoon and hold a trail when a finger is dragged through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from heat; whisk in mustard, salt, garlic powder, paprika, and bouillon until dissolved and well combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Gradually whisk in Cheddar, smoked Cheddar, and 1 cup of the Colby Jack, one cup at a time, until melted and smooth.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in cooked pasta until evenly coated. Spread half of the pasta mixture (about 5 cups) into prepared pan; top evenly with 1 cup of the mozzarella and 1/2 cup of the Colby Jack. Dollop and spread sour cream evenly over mozzarella mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Top evenly with remaining pasta mixture (about 5 cups); sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella and 1/2 cup Colby Jack.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sprinkle crushed cracker mixture evenly over pasta mixture.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until pasta mixture is bubbly around the edges, 25 to 30 minutes, loosely covering with aluminum foil to prevent overbrowning, if needed. Let stand on a wire rack 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Garnish with chives and serve immediately.</li>

    </ol>
